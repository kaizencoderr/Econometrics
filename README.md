# Econometrics-Economic Analysis

#### Path: Econometrics-Economic-Analysis/Econometrics/
Description:  This folder contains 5 problem sets from my econometrics course.  Topics such as the linear regression model and its estimator, Ordinary Least Squares, as well as extensions such as Instrumental Variables models, panel data models, and time series models.  In addition, we explore statistical concepts such as a/b hypothesis testing, random variables, probability distributions, t-tests, p-values, confidence intervals, collinearity, and omitted variable bias.
