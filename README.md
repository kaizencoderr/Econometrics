#### Path: Econometrics-Economic-Analysis/Econometrics/
Description:  This folder contains 5 problem sets from my econometrics course.  Topics such as the linear regression model and its estimator, Ordinary Least Squares, as well as extensions such as Instrumental Variables models, panel data models, and time series models.  In addition, we explore statistical concepts such as a/b hypothesis testing, random variables, probability distributions, t-tests, p-values, confidence intervals, collinearity, and omitted variable bias.

#### Path: Econometrics-Economic-Analysis/Macro Analysis/
Description: This folder contains my reserch project from Macro Analysis.  In this paper I compare and contrast the monetary policy of New Zealand in the 1980’s and 1990’s with the monetary policy of the U.S. in the 1980’s. The evolution of the monetary policy model following a shock or series of shocks is thoroughly discussed, using these two countries as concrete examples.
